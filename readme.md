# Flutter Web Application in Docker

This guide explains how to build your Flutter web application, create a Dockerfile, build a Docker image, and run a Docker container to serve your application using Nginx.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK
- Docker

## Steps

### 1. Build Your Flutter Web Project

First, ensure you have built your Flutter web project.

```sh
flutter build web
```
````

This will create a `build/web` directory containing the compiled web application.

### 2. Create a Dockerfile

Navigate to the `build/web` directory and create a `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Nginx image as the base image
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build output to the Nginx html directory
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### 3. Build the Docker Image

Run the following command from the `build/web` directory to build the Docker image:

```sh
docker build -t flutter-web-app .
```

### 4. Run the Docker Container

Run the following command to start the Docker container:

```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:80 flutter-web-app
```

This command maps port 8080 on your local machine to port 80 in the Docker container, allowing you to access your Flutter web app via `http://localhost:8080`.

### 5. Verify Your Application

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see your Flutter web application running.

## Full Steps Recap

1. **Build your Flutter web project**:

   ```sh
   flutter build web
   ```

2. **Create or adjust the `Dockerfile`** in the `build/web` directory:

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use the official Nginx image as the base image
   FROM nginx:alpine

   # Copy the build output to the Nginx html directory
   COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

   # Expose port 80
   EXPOSE 80

   # Start Nginx server
   CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
   ```

3. **Build the Docker image**:

   ```sh
   docker build -t flutter-web-app .
   ```

4. **Run the Docker container**:

   ```sh
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 flutter-web-app
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to build and run your Flutter web application in a Docker container successfully.

Azure Container Registery

1. creat the resource
2. enable admin login from access key
3. login in you system with that cotnainer ecosytem :- docker login 'url'
4. use tag commant to our container :- docker tag flutter-web-app:latest 'url'
5. check detail with docker images command :- docker images
6. use docker push command :- docker push

Examle :-

1. To see the images on the local machine

docker images

2. First log into your Azure container registry

docker login flutterwebappcontainer.azurecr.io

3. Then we need to tag the Docker image

docker tag learningapp:latest flutterwebappcontainer.azurecr.io/flutter-web-app:latest

4. The push the image onto the Azure container registry

docker push flutterwebappcontainer.azurecr.io/flutter-web-app:latest
